And many people ask why they should do more. I understand those concerns. And I agree that some of the efforts seem unfair. But I ask people to recognise the other alternatives which will be much more difficult for Greece and will affect even more the most vulnerable in the Greek society. So this is why it is the right approach to ask Greece to reform, to increase its competitiveness to have a viable future, irrespective of the crisis. You, in Greece, with our support, need to rebuild your country, your structures, your administration, your economy to increase the competitiveness of Greece. And the best hope of a return to growth and job creation is inside the euro area. Staying in the euro is the best chance to avoid worse hardship and difficulties to the Greek people, namely for those in a more vulnerable position',\n",

      "Today I want to send a clear message to the people of this great country , of Greece . I know that many people feel without hope . Many are making extremely difficult sacrifices . And many people ask why they should do more . I understand those concerns . And I agree that some of the efforts seem unfair . But I ask people to recognise the other alternatives which will be much more difficult for Greece and will affect even more the most vulnerable in the Greek society . So this is why it is the right approach to ask Greece to reform , to increase its competitiveness to have a viable future , irrespective of the crisis . You , in Greece , with our support , need to rebuild your country , your structures , your administration , your economy ('to', 'B-E') increase the competitiveness of Greece . ('And', 'B-E') ('the', 'I-E') ('best', 'I-E') ('hope', 'I-E') ('of', 'I-E') ('a', 'I-E') return to growth and job creation is inside the euro area . Staying in the euro is the best chance to avoid worse hardship and difficulties to the Greek people , namely for those in a more vulnerable position "
